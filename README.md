Welcome! I wanted to create a small space where I could enjoy the fun that are HTML Canvases.

Those of you who have worked with them know their potential, but also their ultimate frustration.

There will be no libraries here. Nothing but clean cut Javascript doing its thing to draw bits on maps.
I'll do my best to support mobile, but meh. Mouse events and touch events are the devil.
